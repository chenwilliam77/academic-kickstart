I am a senior research analyst at the NY Fed, working with the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) team on academic research, policy analysis, forecasting, and model development. 

I am also a lead developer of [DSGE.jl](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl), a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package for solving, estimating, and forecasting DSGE models, as well as [SMC.jl](https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/SMC.jl), which implements sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling for approximation of posterior distributions.
